/**
 * An interface to an object that describes characteristics of a table based
 * object in the database.  This can represent anything that evaluates to a
 * Table when the query plan is evaluated.  It is used to represent data tables
 * and views.
 * <p>
 * This object is used by the planner to see ahead of time what sort of table
 * we are dealing with.  For example, a view is stored with a DataTableDef
 * describing the resultant columns, and the QueryPlanNode to produce the
 * view result.  The query planner requires the information in DataTableDef
 * to resolve references in the query, and the QueryPlanNode to add into the
 * resultant plan tree.
