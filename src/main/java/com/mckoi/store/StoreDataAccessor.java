 * An interface for low level store data access methods.  This is used to

 * a file in a filesystem.  For example, we might use this to access a file
 * using the NIO API, or through the IO API.  Alternatively we may use it to
 * implement a scattering store that includes data across multiple files in the
 * filesystem.
